## Overview
1335494 introduced revisioning to bean (https://drupal.org/node/1335494). This
is a useful feature but for many sites, it's not necessary and might be
confusing for some admins that are editing bean blocks. This simple module
hides the checkbox on the bean edit form sets its value to disabled and hides
the revision log field.

## Usage
Just enable the module to disable revisions. There is no configuration page. If
you want to turn revisions back on, just disable the module.
